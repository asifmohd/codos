# CODOS

A react app built using create-react-app and typescript.

The app hits public APIs of Practo Order with user's search text and shows medicines found for the result.

User can then add medicines to their cart.

The app is live on [https://frozen-island-98934.herokuapp.com/](https://frozen-island-98934.herokuapp.com/[])

### TODO:
- let users view the items in their cart as well
- use redux
